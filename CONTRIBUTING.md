# Contributing

Thank you for thinking about contributing. This is a small project that really
only existed to support an interest in reverse engineering Apple II application
binaries. _Really_  small.

So small that I don't think there is much that can be added to it. Still,
something compelling may be presented. Any bug reports, or preferably fixes,
will be appreciated.

## Guidelines

Content is encouraged, but a well thought out defect report is welcome. That
requires the following:
 - A clear description of how current behavior deviates from desired or expected
   (note that is often a matter of opinion and someone else may disagree with
   you).
 - Instructions to reproduce. It's hard to give guidance on how detailed the
   instructions have to be. Be prepared to negotiate.
 - Test data or assets as required. Given that Ghidra is a reverse engineering
   tool, it's probably necessary to mention that you can't supply someone's
   proprietary code. If you have to, recreate the problem with unencumbered
   test data.

Before contributing code, please review the LICENSE and NOTICE files. To keep
things simple, contributions must be made with an Apache License, Version 2.0.
Contributed code must be correctly attributed. This may be by combining the
code contributed with an update to the NOTICE file.

No reformatting of code to suit your preferred line breaks, indentation, imports
organization, etc. This is mostly because changes like this mess with source
control blame annotations.

While your own contributions are not going to be exhaustively checked against a
312 point code style guide,do roughly follow the style of the files you are
modifying so that your own contribution looks like it belongs there.

That's about it in terms of formal guidelines. This project is currently very
much a one man show in the quiet hours after dinner. There is no social media.
There is no project website. Code review consists of a quick once over without
too many "Ewww!" moments.
